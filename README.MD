Follow these Steps to make thousands of custom NFTs:
1. Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/bcorbs/NFT-Art_Gen`
2. Enter the downloaded folder by typing `cd NFT-Art_Gen`
3. Add all your layer files in the 'traits' folder. They should be separated in different layer folders.
4. Add the probability of each trait. You can do this by adding the number after a '#' in the file name. For example, if the 'Background' layer had two files called 'Black#50.png' and 'White#50.png' then there would be a 50% chance of each being selected.
5. Edit the `config.py` file with your settings.
6. Run `generator.py`
