Follow these Steps to make thousands of custom NFTs:
1. Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/bcorbs/NFT-Art_Gen`
2. Enter the downloaded folder by typing `cd NFT-Art_Gen`
3. Create two folders called "traits" and "output"
4. Within the traits folder, make a folder for each trait that your NFTs will have and place those traits within their respective folder. 
5. Add the probability of each trait. You can do this by adding the number after a '#' in the file name. For example, if the 'Background' layer had two files called 'Black#50.png' and 'White#50.png' then there would be a 50% chance of each being selected. Note: These percentages DO NOT have to add to 100%
6. Edit the `config.py` file with your settings.
7. Run `generator.py`
